The Result type is used when a function can return either a value or an error, while the Option type is used when a function can return either a value or None.\n\n## Option Enum\nThe Option enum has two variants: Some and None. It's commonly used when a function may or may not return a value. For example, here's a function that returns an Option:\n\n```rust\nfn find_divisor(num: i32, divisor: i32) -> Option<i32> {\n    if num % divisor == 0 {\n        Some(divisor)\n    } else {\n        None\n    }\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    match find_divisor(20, 4) {\n        Some(divisor) => println!(\"The divisor is: {}\", divisor),\n        None => println!(\"No divisor found.\"),\n    }\n}\n```\n\n## Result Enum\nThe Result enum has two variants: Ok and Err. It's used when a function can return either a successful value or an error. For example, here's a function that returns a Result:\n\n```rust\nuse std::num::ParseIntError;\n\nfn parse_integer(input: &str) -> Result<i32, ParseIntError> {\n    input.parse::<i32>()\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    match parse_integer(\"42\") {\n        Ok(number) => println!(\"The number is: {}\", number),\n        Err(e) => println!(\"Error parsing number: {}\", e),\n    }\n}\n```\n\n# Error Propagation with ?

When placed after an expression that returns a Result, the ? operator will return the Ok variant's value if successful, or return early with the Err variant. Here's an example:\n\n```rust\nuse std::fs::File;\nuse std::io::Read;\nuse std::io;\n\nfn read_file_contents(filename: &str) -> Result<String, io::Error> {\n    let mut file = File::open(filename)?;\n    let mut contents = String::new();\n    file.read_to_string(&mut contents)?;\n    Ok(contents)\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    match read_file_contents(\"file.txt\") {\n        Ok(contents) => println!(\"File contents: {}\", contents),\n        Err(e) => println!(\"Error reading file: {}\", e),\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the ? operator allows us to propagate the error to the calling function, simplifying the error handling process.\n",

Rust's memory model addresses common pitfalls of other languages, such as null pointer dereferences, buffer overflows, and data races, without the need for a garbage collector. Let's take a closer look at Rust's memory model.\n\n## The Ownership System: A Core Concept\n\nAt the heart of Rust's memory model is its ownership system, which ensures that every piece of data has a single owner. This system enforces three key rules:\n\n1. Each value in Rust has one, and only one, owner.\n2. When the owner goes out of scope, the value is automatically dropped (deallocated).\n3. A value can either have a single mutable reference or multiple immutable references, but not both.\nBy adhering to these rules, Rust effectively prevents double-frees and use-after-free vulnerabilities, which often lead to security issues in other languages.\n\n## Borrowing and Lifetimes: Safe Access to Data\n\nRust's borrowing mechanism allows data to be temporarily accessed through references without violating ownership rules. Borrowing comes in two flavors: mutable and immutable. Immutable borrows permit multiple references to read data simultaneously, while mutable borrows allow only one reference to modify the data. These restrictions prevent data races and ensure safe concurrent access to shared resources.\n\nLifetimes, another key concept in Rust, further enhance safety by ensuring that borrowed references never outlive the data they refer to.

This deterministic memory management allows for predictable performance and fine-grained control over resource usage, which is especially beneficial for low-level systems programming and real-time applications.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nRust's memory model offers a unique combination of safety and performance. By leveraging ownership, borrowing, and lifetimes, we can write code that is both memory-safe and efficient, without the overhead of a garbage collector.\n",
